        Hi there, my name is Joel Gutierrez and I am a coder, developer, and
        designer. I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from
        the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley with a focus in Web, App, and
        Game Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I received also a certificate in UX Design to expand my knowledge in
        graphic design and project management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also received a certificate in Substitute Teaching for a job as an
        Instructor for our After School programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also returned to school to study for a Masters degree at the
        University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, and after I finish my Master's
        degree, I am looking to get a Doctorate of Business Administration when
        I am done.
      </p>
      <p>During my downtime, I like to plan out my month for any holidays, family
        events, or vacation days to re-energeize and be inspired for new challenges.
